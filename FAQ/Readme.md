# Falcon F16/F48 V4 Frequently Asked Questions/Issues

Please see the manual https://docs.google.com/document/d/1449zGk1HEiQjcu6e98ebWnFBMFKUiXaFzis9QGAnfsk/edit 

## Ports 17-32 Not Working on a F48

When the controller is in 32 port mode to get 1024 pixels per output Ports 17-32 are actually Ports 33-48 on the board. This is to allow the user to use the onboard receiver.

## Playback stops when playing a sequence from the SD Card

The most common reason we have seen for this is not using a sufficiently high quality SD Card. We recommend 8-32GB SanDisk Class 10 SD Cards. Other cards will likely work but we have seen issues with cheaper no-name cards. When the issue occurs the sequence will just stop playing part way through and may display a timeout if you have logging turned on.

## Controller Status Page Has Blank Board Type

The best fix for this is to factory reset the controller by applying power while the select button is held down.

## Controller OLED does not display anything when power is applied

The most common reasons for this are:

- Applying 5V but having the voltage selector set to 12V.
- Habing the External power switch set incorrectly.

## Network Green/Amber Lights dont light when network is connected

Verify you have plugged the internet into one of the two silver RJ45 connectors with the black insides.

## LOR/DMX Devices not seeing a signal

Verify all 3 jumpers next to the DMX RJ45 port are set to the right position.

## Wifi Web Page Returns 404 Errors

Install/Reinstall the latest V4 firmware.

## TM1814 pixels flicker

This definitely can happen if you have more pixels attached than the controller is driving so please make sure you are sending data to all pixels.
