    - Fix : Serial port page make valid does not take into account first channel if settings
    - Fix : copy, cut, paste keyboard keys dont work on web pages
    - Fix : Port testing does not work correctly where first channel is not 1
    - Fix : When switching to E131 allocate at least enough universes for all configured outputs
    - Fix : Add a workaround for a very rare hang we are occasionally seeing in pixel output such that the controller will auto resume 
            after 200ms. We do not have an exact cause but factors such as using DDP and smart remotes seem to be common factors but the 
            rareness of the hang has made it really hard to be definite that any or all of these are actually associated with it.

Build 7: 2021-09-26
