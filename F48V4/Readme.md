To download the FL3 file:

1. Click on the .fl3 file above
2. Near the right hand side of the screen will be a Raw button followed by 2 icons. The rightmost button is the download. Click that button to download the file.
3. The file will download to the usual location when you download files to your computer.
4. Now you can upload the file to the controller or place it on an SD card to load it.

If the controller complains the file is not valid the most likely reasons are downloading it incorrectly or trying to apply F48 firmware onto a F16 or vice-versa.

If all else fails email Support and we will email you the file.

WARNING: Do NOT right click on the filename and select "Save Link As" ... this will not download a valid file!
