To upgrade the F48V4 firmware:

1. Download the chosen F48V4 firmware fl3 file. This file will be named Falcon_48_Firmware_<build>.fl3
2. Either
	- Place the file onto an SD card and place that SD card in the SD slot on the controller and reboot 
	  the conntroller. When the controller boots it will copy the file into flash ram on the board. Remove 
	  the SD card when done and reboot the controller; or
	- Navigate to the settings page on the controller web menu and select the "Update Firmware" link and 
	  upload the downloaded fl3 file. Once done the controller will reboot.
3. During the reboot the controller will validate the firmware. If it is incomplete or invalid the controller 
   will tell you and delete the firmware without changing anything.
4. If valid the controller will upgrade the firmware in generally the following order
	- CPU 1
	- CPU 2
	- ESP (the wifi module code)
	- ESP Files (the wifi web interface)
5. Then it will erase the firmware files from flash ram (so it doesnt keep doing the upgrade)
6. If successful the OLED screen and the status web page should show the correct build number. To check the 
   ESP (wifi) updated you will need to access the wifi page. If you dont use the wifi interface then you can 
   ignore this.
